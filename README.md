# Project Overview
This project is a machine learning application developed in Python that predicts product ratings based on customer review text using the Amazon Reviews 23 dataset. It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature extraction, and basic predictive modeling techniques.

# Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning of large JSON-formatted review data

Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization on review text

Implementation of a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest) to predict product ratings

Exploration and analysis of dataset characteristics using pandas and matplotlib

Modular code structure for easy extension and experimentation

# Technologies Used
Python 3.x

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib

NumPy

# How to Use
Clone the repository

Install the required Python packages (preferably in a virtual environment):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts in the /src folder to preprocess data and train the model

Modify or extend the model and preprocessing steps as desired

# Future Improvements
Implement more advanced natural language processing techniques (e.g., word embeddings, transformers)

Experiment with deeper or ensemble machine learning models

Enhance data cleaning to handle edge cases and missing data

Add a web interface or API for real-time predictions

Notes
This project was primarily developed and coded independently as part of a team assignment.

The implementation is functional but could be further optimized and improved with additional time and resources.
